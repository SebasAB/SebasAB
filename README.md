- 👋 Hi, I’m @SebasAB (Sebastián Aliaga)
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development in general. But I'm liking a lot working in the backend, so maybe I'll take that path, I'm not quite sure yet.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, next I'll be learning React, MongoDB, NodeJS and Express to have the MERN stack. And for the backend the language that I'm liking a lot is Django, but I'm also looking forward learning PHP. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? Send me an email: sebasaliaga2515@gmail.com
