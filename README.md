- 👋 Hi, I’m @SebasAB (Sebastián Aliaga)
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development in general. But I'm also looking forward to learn Python for ML, AI and Data Science, but also the Django framework seems nice. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, next I'll be learning React and Angular, after those front-end frameworks I'll be starting to learn Node.js, Express, MongoDB and MariaDB, and a back-end language, like Java or Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? Send me an email: sebasaliaga2515@gmail.com
